# routemaster-blog
A small but realistic blog application that demonstrates every kind of Laravel route, including:  Simple pages (/, /about, /contact)  Dynamic routes with parameters (/posts/{slug})  Route groups (admin area)  Route model binding (Post::class)  Middleware (auth simulation)  Route prefixes, subdomains, and rate limiters.
